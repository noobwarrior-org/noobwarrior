// Description: A widget that allows the user to reorganize content in a way they like by putting them into directories
// This is different from the regular content browser because that organizes stuff on its own according to what it's
// seeing in the SQLite database. This lets you organize it yourself
// This works more like a traditional file manager, with tree views and rearranging files and all of that shit.
