# Welcome to the documentation for noobWarrior

Hello, and thanks for stumbling across this page. You're on the first page of the extensive documentation for noobWarrior, a program that serves as a decentralized platform, a game preservation toolkit, and a server emulator for Roblox. It aims to be an all-in-one self-contained toolkit for everything Roblox.

This documentation is a guide for everything that has to do with noobWarrior; its history, how to use it, how the technicals work, the reason why it works the way it does, how to produce content using it, basically everything.
